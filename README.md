# Pet Shelter Website
4 hours to make this pet shelter website.

You can add pets to the shelter. Pet names must be unique. Minor validations (description length 3 characters, etc.)
You can edit pet details and reroute to pet details. Each user can upvote a pet once and then the button disables, until the page is refreshed.
If a user decides to adopt the pet, it removes the pet from the database.
